   <h2>Subspecies</h2>
   Following Linnaeus's first descriptions of the species, several tiger zoological specimens were described and proposed as subspecies.[10] The validity of several tiger subspecies was questioned in 1999. Most putative subspecies described in the 19th and 20th centuries were distinguished on the basis of fur length and colouration, striping patterns and body size, hence characteristics that vary widely within populations. Morphologically, tigers from different regions vary little, and gene flow between populations in those regions is considered to have been possible during the Pleistocene. Therefore, it was proposed to recognize only two tiger subspecies as valid, namely P. t. tigris in mainland Asia, and P. t. sondaica in the Greater Sunda Islands. Mainland tigers are described as being larger in size with generally lighter fur and fewer stripes, while island tiger are smaller due to insular dwarfism, with darker coats and more numerous stripes on the sides.[11] The stripes of island tigers may break up into spotted patterns.[

   This two-subspecies proposal was reaffirmed in 2015 by a comprehensive analysis of morphological, ecological and molecular traits of all putative tiger subspecies using a combined approach. The authors proposed recognition of only two subspecies, namely P. t. tigris comprising the Bengal, Malayan, Indochinese, South Chinese, Siberian and Caspian tiger populations of continental Asia, and P. t. sondaica comprising the Javan, Bali and Sumatran tiger populations of the Sunda Islands. The continental nominate subspecies P. t. tigris constitutes two clades: a northern clade composed of the Siberian and Caspian tiger populations, and a southern clade composed of all other mainland populations. The authors noted that this two-subspecies reclassification will impact tiger conservation management.[13] It would make captive breeding programs and future re-wilding of zoo-born tigers easier, as one tiger population could then be used to reinforce another. However, there is the risk that the loss of subspecies uniqueness could lead to less protection efforts for specific populations.

   In 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the IUCN Cat Specialist Group revised felid taxonomy in accordance with the two-subspecies proposal of the comprehensive 2015 study, and recognized the tiger populations in continental Asia as P. t. tigris, and those in the Sunda Islands as P. t. sondaica.[15] This two-subspecies view is still disputed by researchers, since the currently recognized six living subspecies can be distinguished genetically.[14] Results of a 2018 whole-genome sequencing of 32 samples support six monophyletic tiger clades corresponding with the living subspecies and indicate they descended from a common ancestor around 110,000 years ago.[16] A 2021 study also affirmed the genetic distinctiveness of these subspecies.[17]

   The following tables are based on the classification of the species Panthera tigris provided in Mammal Species of the World,[10] and also reflect the classification used by the Cat Classification Task Force in 2017:
